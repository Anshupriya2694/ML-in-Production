## Population-Segmentation

This project trains and deploys unsupervised learning models - PCA and k-Means clustering to group US counties by similaties and differences on AWS Sagemaker.

The data used is a portion of [US census data](https://www.census.gov/data.html). This is combined with unsupervised learning methods, extract meaningful components from that data and group regions by similar census-recorded characteristics. The insights obtained by deep diving into Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and K-Means clustering methods results in groupings that are used to inform things like localized marketing campaigns and voter campaign strategies.
