## Machine Learning in Production (Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program)

This repository is a culmination of multiple Machine Learning Project created and deployed using AWS Sagemaker. The focus is on deployment tools and the machine learning workflow; answering a few big questions along the way:

* How to decide on the correct machine learning algorithm for a given task?
* How to utilize cloud ML services in SageMaker to work with interesting datasets or improve our algorithms?

To approach these questions, there are multiple real-world case studies, and steps from task and problem formulation to deploying models in SageMaker.

The ipynb files for each study will be present in this repository.

#### Case Study 1 - Population Segmentation using SageMaker

This project trains and deploys unsupervised learning models - PCA and k-Means clustering to group US counties by similaties and differences on AWS Sagemaker.

The data used is a portion of [US census data](https://www.census.gov/data.html). This is combined with unsupervised learning methods, extract meaningful components from that data and group regions by similar census-recorded characteristics. The insights obtained by deep diving into Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and K-Means clustering methods results in groupings that are used to inform things like localized marketing campaigns and voter campaign strategies.

#### Case Study 2 - Payment Fraud Detection

This case will demonstrate how to use supervised learning techniques, specifically SageMakerâ€™s LinearLearner, for fraud detection. The payment transaction dataset is unbalanced, with many more examples of valid transactions vs. fraudulent, and I have investigated methods for compensating for this imbalance and tuning the model to improve its performance according to a specific product goal.

I have also worked on the same kaggle dataset for another project under my course IDS702 during the fall of 2019. The link for that project is - [Credit Card Fraud Detection] (https://github.com/Anshupriya2694/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection). This project is written in R and explores Machine Learning Techniques like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Trees.

#### Case Study 3 - Custom Models - Non-Linear Classification [Moon Data Classification]

This case study demonstrates how to manage cases where classes of data are not separable by a linear line. A custom PyTorch neural network used for classifying data is trained and deployed.
The pytorch model classifies "moon data" (2-dimensional data whose classes are distributed to look a bit like moons in 2D space).
